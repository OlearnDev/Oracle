1.Parsing:

	Checks for valid SQL syntax.
	Breaks the query into its components (SELECT, FROM, WHERE clauses).
	Builds a parse tree representing the query structure.

2.Binding:

	Assigns actual values to any placeholder variables (bind variables) in the query.
	May perform data type conversions if necessary.
	Creates a query tree with concrete data values.

3.Optimization (by the Optimizer):

	Analyzes the query tree and available statistics about the data.
	Evaluates different execution plans (like using indexes, join methods) based on cost estimation.
	Selects the most efficient execution plan to retrieve the data.

4.Execution:

	Executes the chosen execution plan against the database tables.
	Retrieves data based on the selected access paths and operations.
	Returns the final result set to the application.
