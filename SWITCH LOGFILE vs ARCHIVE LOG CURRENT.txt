SWITCH LOGFILE vs ARCHIVE LOG CURRENT:
1. No-Wait vs Wait
The first difference is the responses. ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE is a no-wait statement, once it was issued by DBA, it'll 
return to the user and do the switching in the background. On the other side, ALTER SYSTEM ARCHIVE LOG CURRENT will wait for 
Archiver Process (ARCH) to complete the archiving and then return to user.

SQL> set timing on;
SQL> alter system switch logfile;
System altered.
Elapsed: 00:00:00.04

SQL> alter system archive log current;
System altered.
Elapsed: 00:00:00.12

2. Data Guard
A big difference can be seen in data guard environments, especially in 9i.

SQL> alter system archive log current;
System altered.
Elapsed: 00:01:46.87

As you can see, ALTER SYSTEM ARCHIVE LOG CURRENT takes almost 2 minutes for a 1GB redo logs to return. This is because it's 
waiting for the completion of network transferring and archiving on the remote standby database. Also, the larger redo size, 
the longer it takes.

3. RAC Database
For a cluster database, statement ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE affects only the current instance whereas ALTER SYSTEM ARCHIVE LOG
 CURRENT makes redo log switch on all nodes (threads).

Let's see all statuses of groups before switching.

SQL> select thread#, instance_name from v$instance;
 THREAD# INSTANCE_NAME
---------- ----------------
 1 TESTCDB1

SQL> select thread#, group#, status from v$log order by 1,2;
 THREAD#   GROUP# STATUS
---------- ---------- ----------------
 1     1 INACTIVE
 1     3 INACTIVE
 1     5 CURRENT
 2     2 CURRENT
 2     4 INACTIVE
 2     6 INACTIVE
6 rows selected.

ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE
First of all, we make a switch log file.

SQL> alter system switch logfile;
System altered.

SQL> select thread#, group#, status from v$log order by 1,2;
 THREAD#   GROUP# STATUS
---------- ---------- ----------------
 1     1 CURRENT
 1     3 INACTIVE
 1     5 ACTIVE
 2     2 CURRENT
 2     4 INACTIVE
 2     6 INACTIVE
6 rows selected.

ALTER SYSTEM ARCHIVE LOG CURRENT
By default, it switches redo groups on all nodes (threads).

SQL> alter system archive log current;
System altered.

SQL> select thread#, group#, status from v$log order by 1,2;
 THREAD#   GROUP# STATUS
---------- ---------- ----------------
 1     1 ACTIVE
 1     3 CURRENT
 1     5 INACTIVE
 2     2 ACTIVE
 2     4 CURRENT
 2     6 INACTIVE

6 rows selected.
