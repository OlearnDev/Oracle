An *Oracle SQL Profile* is a database object that contains auxiliary information about a SQL statement, which helps the Oracle 
optimizer generate a more efficient execution plan. It is part of Oracle''s *SQL Tuning* features and is created using the 
*SQL Tuning Advisor* or *Automatic SQL Tuning*.

SQL Profiles are particularly useful when the optimizer cannot generate an optimal execution plan due to missing or incomplete 
statistics, complex queries, or other factors. They provide additional information to the optimizer, such as:

- *Cardinality estimates*: More accurate row count estimates for intermediate results.
- *Selectivity estimates*: Better estimates of how selective predicates are.
- *Cost adjustments*: Adjustments to the cost calculations used by the optimizer.

Unlike *SQL Plan Baselines*, which lock in a specific execution plan, SQL Profiles provide hints to the optimizer without 
forcing a particular plan. This allows the optimizer to adapt to changes in data distribution or database configuration.

### *Key Features of SQL Profiles*
1. Optimizer Guidance: SQL Profiles provide additional information to the optimizer, helping it make better decisions.
2. Adaptability: They do not lock the optimizer into a specific plan, allowing flexibility as data or system conditions change.
3. Automatic Creation: SQL Profiles can be created automatically by the **Automatic SQL Tuning Advisor* during maintenance windows.
4. Manual Creation: They can also be created manually using the **SQL Tuning Advisor*.

### *How SQL Profiles Work*
1. *Identify Problematic SQL*: A SQL statement with poor performance is identified (e.g., through AWR reports, SQL Monitoring, 
   or manual analysis).
2. *Run SQL Tuning Advisor*: The SQL Tuning Advisor analyzes the SQL statement and recommends a SQL Profile if it finds a 
   better execution plan.
3. *Create SQL Profile*: If accepted, the SQL Profile is created and stored in the database.
4. *Optimizer Uses SQL Profile*: For subsequent executions of the SQL statement, the optimizer uses the information in the SQL 
   Profile to generate a better execution plan.

### *Creating a SQL Profile*
#### *1. Using SQL Tuning Advisor*
- Identify the SQL ID of the problematic query:
  sql
  SELECT sql_id, sql_text FROM v$sql WHERE sql_text LIKE '%your_query%';
  
- Run the SQL Tuning Advisor:
  sql
  DECLARE
    l_task_name VARCHAR2(30);
  BEGIN
    l_task_name := DBMS_SQLTUNE.CREATE_TUNING_TASK(
      sql_id      => 'your_sql_id',
      scope       => DBMS_SQLTUNE.SCOPE_COMPREHENSIVE,
      time_limit  => 60,
      task_name   => 'tune_sql_task',
      description => 'Tune SQL statement'
    );
    DBMS_SQLTUNE.EXECUTE_TUNING_TASK(task_name => 'tune_sql_task');
  END;
  /
  
- Check the recommendations:
  sql
  SELECT DBMS_SQLTUNE.REPORT_TUNING_TASK('tune_sql_task') FROM dual;
  
- Accept the SQL Profile if recommended:
  sql
  EXEC DBMS_SQLTUNE.ACCEPT_SQL_PROFILE(task_name => 'tune_sql_task', task_owner => 'SYS', replace => TRUE);
  

#### *2. Using Automatic SQL Tuning*
- Automatic SQL Tuning runs during maintenance windows and identifies high-load SQL statements.
- It automatically creates and tests SQL Profiles for these statements.
- You can view and manage automatic SQL Profiles using the DBA_ADVISOR_EXECUTIONS and DBA_SQL_PROFILES views.

### *Managing SQL Profiles*
- *View SQL Profiles*:
  sql
  SELECT name, category, status, sql_text FROM dba_sql_profiles;
  
- *Enable/Disable a SQL Profile*:
  sql
  EXEC DBMS_SQLTUNE.ALTER_SQL_PROFILE(name => 'your_profile_name', attribute_name => 'STATUS', value => 'DISABLED');
  
- *Drop a SQL Profile*:
  sql
  EXEC DBMS_SQLTUNE.DROP_SQL_PROFILE(name => 'your_profile_name');

### *Benefits of SQL Profiles*
1. *Improved Performance*: Helps the optimizer generate better execution plans, leading to faster query execution.
2. *No Code Changes*: Requires no changes to the SQL statement or application code.
3. *Adaptability*: Allows the optimizer to adapt to changes in data or system conditions.
4. *Low Maintenance*: Once created, SQL Profiles require minimal maintenance.

---

### *Limitations of SQL Profiles*
1. *Not a Silver Bullet*: SQL Profiles may not always resolve performance issues, especially if the underlying problem is 
   related to schema design or indexing.
2. *Dependency on Statistics*: SQL Profiles rely on accurate statistics. If statistics are outdated, the profile may not be 
    effective.
3. *Storage Overhead*: SQL Profiles consume storage in the database.

### *Conclusion*
Oracle SQL Profiles are a powerful tool for improving SQL performance by providing the optimizer with additional information to 
generate better execution plans. They are created and managed using the SQL Tuning Advisor or Automatic SQL Tuning and can 
significantly enhance query performance without requiring changes to the SQL statement or application code. However, they should
 be used in conjunction with other performance tuning techniques for optimal
